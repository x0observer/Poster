Brief description of your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the application and PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
Create a .env file in the project root directory and configure your environment variables. You can use the provided .env.example as a template.

Build and start the Docker containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This command will build the Docker images and start the containers in detached mode.

Access your application at http://localhost:9999.

Stopping the Application
To stop the application and remove the containers, run the following command in the project root directory:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
Configuration
You can customize the application and database configurations by editing the environment variables in the .env file.

3. Save the `README.md` file.

4. Make sure you have a `.env.example` file that provides a template for the environment variables needed by your application. Users can copy this file and configure it with their own values.

5. Commit the `README.md` and `.env.example` files to your Git repository:

```bash
git add README.md .env.example
git commit -m "Add README.md and .env.example"
git push
Now, your project should have a README file that provides instructions for setting up and running the application using Docker Compose. Users can follow these instructions to get your application up and running.
